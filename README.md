## Tests
A significant portion of this project relied on testing. The code written for the tasks of defining and exporting each of the Employee classes, and for each job classes that inherited from Employee. Because I had some difficulty developing the HTML files to display team inputs, I want to still highlight here that the lib file of employee functions still passed each test. Below you can see this, with 4 test suites and 17 tests in total. Testing requires entering "npm test" into the command line.
